# Geopicasso
## A sort of art project based on a continuous drawing of circles or polygons.
### This is something I've written and rewritten a few times when trying to learn a new language or library.
### Based on: http://www.sievesofchaos.com/

## Example usage:

#### (from resource file)
```
lein run <resourcefilename>
eg: "lein run lady.edn"
```

#### (from spec generation)
```
lein run
```
